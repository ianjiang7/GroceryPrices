## Purpose of data collection
I'm collecting this data hoping to help people interviewing for positions with brainteaser portions of interviews
## Source + robots.txt
I have checked beforehand in geekforgeeks' robots.txt file that they allow webscraping on their site
## Practices
I only scrape the site once when the program runs and I don't bypass any password protections
## Data handling and privacy
I'm not collecting nor storing any user data
## Data Usage
The scraped data is being used for educational purposes only
